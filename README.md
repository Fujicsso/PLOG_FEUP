# PLOG

In the files "P1" and "P2" are the 2 projects developed for this curricular unit.
To run them just install Sicstus (for work one) and SwiProlog (for work 2) and run: main.pl and type "play." for "P1" / aztec.pl and type "aztec." for "P2".

The first work is a reproduction of the game Nudge, with the instructions on the PDF included.
the second work is a solver and creator of puzzles, in this case, making Aztec puzzles. The rest of the instructions can be found at the PDF as well.
